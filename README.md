We detail distributed algorithms for scalable, secure multi-party linear regression and feature selection at essentially the same speed as plaintext regression. While the core geometric ideas are simple, their utility in combination for feature selection appears to be novel. Our scheme opens the door to efficient and secure genome-wide association studies across multiple biobanks.

Read the [arXiv note](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09531) and watch the [primer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3NxvLC-5s4&list=PLlMMtlgw6qNjROoMNTBQjAcdx53kV50cS) at [Models, Inference & Algorithms](broadinstitute.org/mia) at the Broad Institute.

We recently found that the approach in Section 2 to secure linear regression has been explored since at least 2005, c.f. (Secure Regression on Distributed Databases)[http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~jerry/Papers/jcgs05.pdf].

Run a [Python demo](https://github.com/jbloom22/DASH/blob/master/multiparty_linear_regression.ipynb) of the multi-party linear regression algorithm in Section 2.

Run a [Python demo](https://github.com/jbloom22/DASH/blob/master/dash.ipynb) and [R demo](https://github.com/jbloom22/DASH/blob/master/dash.r) of the distributed association scan hammer (DASH) in Section 4.

[Hail](https://hail.is/about.html) uses the single-party distributed algorithm in Section 3 to enable [massive genomic analyses](http://www.nealelab.is/uk-biobank/) and will include multi-party algorithms someday. Also check out the exciting work on secure genomics by [Hoon Cho](https://hhcho.com/), Bonnie Berger and colleagues.

An [OpenMined](https://www.openmined.org/) implementation is being supported by an [RAAIS OpenMined Grant](https://blog.openmined.org/raais/), awarded to [Andr√© Farias](https://github.com/andrelmfarias).
